Data Source: 


We have taken the html files provided in the Data Source and tried to clean it. The data had depreciated too much. Much of the tables are not matched which lead to Foreign key violations. We had to introduce NULL values for these kinds of issues. And resolved the violations and corrected the unmatched values.


We have written python code for creating and inserting the values.


The UI can be accessed with the following command when the current location is where the introduction.py is present:


Streamlit run introduction.py


For this to run successfully we need to have streamlit installed


Use “pip install streamlit”
